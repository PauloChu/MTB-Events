NetLogo is a free-to-use program and can be downloaded at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ , the website also contains tutorials.

The visual data from this program is saved and used with Fiji (is just ImageJ)'s plugin "Mosaic". The Mosaic plugin has a function called Particle Tracking 2D/3D and this was used to track the MTB.
This tracked data is then used with the python program ("Introuction.ipynb) to detect the events. This simulation is essentially used as a control for real-world videos of MTB.
