# MTB_Events
This program was developed to determine the type of events that MTB, or magnetotactic bacteria, specifically AMB-1, undergo while swimming by simply using the bacterium's recorded position. By classifying what an event is, either a tumble or a reverse, we can then correlate the probability of said event to the strength of a magnetic field applied.

To begin, please download the contents of this project. Run "Introduction.ipynb" as a jupyter notebook and follow the instructions laid out. The jupyter notebook takes a look at previously-made data sets using the NetLogo Simulation. Using the NetLogo Simulation, images were made of MTB swimming and then were tracked using ImageJ. More information is available in the NetLogo Simulation folder's ReadMe.
