    "## Get Events\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful function is the \"get_events\" function. The parameters used in this function are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### - filedir\n",
    "a string variable that designates the folder in which your .csv files are stored\n",
    "\n",
    "### - fpra\n",
    "a positive intenger variable, 'frames per rolling average', this variable will take a rolling average of your trajectories. In essence, this will 'smooth' out any imperfections that may be caused by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - frame_threshold_count\n",
    "a positive integer variable where any trajectories with any less updates will be removed from the dataset. Set to 0 if you would like every trajectory to be included, regardless of trajectory length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - heading_std_threshold \n",
    "a positive float between 0 and 2. The heading, or the direction that the trajectory is facing, is a value between 0 and 1 for x and for y. As the trajectory follows, the fpra variable will dictate over how many frames of the trajectory's heading will be used as the standard deviation. The heading standard deviation is then used as a threshold variable to determine if an event has occured. A heading_std_threshold of 0 will consider almost all movements to be an event, and a heading_std_threshold of 2 will guarantee an event will never be considered. The current ideal operating value is 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - speed_fraction \n",
    "a positive float between 0 and 1. Similar to the heading_std_threshold, but with speed. When a trajectory's speed goes below the product of this float and the median of the speed of the trajectory, then an event will be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - write\n",
    "a boolean variable. If True, the program will write a .csv file in the folder with results in the filedir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - debugprints\n",
    "a boolean variable. If True, the program will print results and data for each trajectory in each file.\n"
